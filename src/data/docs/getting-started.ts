export const getting_started = `Welcome to the deployment guide! This guide will help you to deploy the application to Vercel or similar services.

If you are new to this project, you can follow along from the beginning.
But if you've already deployed the app before and want to upgrade from v1, you can skip to the [Migrating from v1](#migrating) section.  
You can also use this guide to [configure the app](#config) and [customize the theme](#theme).

_**Note:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how to deploy a Next.js app on Vercel or other platforms._

#### We recommend you to use this deployment guide on a desktop browser.`;
